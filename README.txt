Getting and Cleaning Data, End of Course Project
==================================================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in acquiring, cleaning, and manipulating data using the R programming language.

The source data come from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, which were collected during experiments carried out by volunteers who performed six activities while wearing a smartphone.  Details about the project can be found here:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create a single data set,
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement,
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set,
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names,
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set containing the 
   average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and
6. Writes the newly created data set to disk.


The solution to this assignment includes the following files:
==================================================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'codebook.md': Describes the variables included in the final data set

- 'run_analysis.R': An R script that downloads the source data set and executes the above tasks

- 'solution.txt': The final, tidy data set generated by the R command, write.table() 


Notes: 
==================================================================
- The final data set is tidy because 1) each row is an aggregate of observations, 2) each variable is a column, and 3) the data form an observational unit.  (Associated X-, Y-, and Z-axis data columns are mutually independent variables; i.e., it is possible to vary one without affecting the other two.)
